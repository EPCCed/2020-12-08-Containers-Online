# Reproducible Computational Environments Using Containers: Introduction to Docker and Singularity

This repository contains materials for the [_Reproducible Computational Environments Using Containers_ course](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/201208-containers/) being run by [Research Software London](https://rslondon.ac.uk) and [EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk), supported by [PRACE](https://prace-ri.eu/) and [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/). 

The course is being run online on Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th December 2020. _Places are now fully booked._

The material in this repository is based on the [Carpentries workshop template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) and is a combination of two lessons from the [Carpentries incubator](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/#the-carpentries-incubator), one [covering Docker](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/docker-introduction) and the other [covering Singularity](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/singularity-introduction). See the individual README's for each lesson for information on contributing, maintainers, authors and how to cite the material:

 - Introduction to Docker: [README.md](README_docker.md)
 - Introduction to Singularity: [README.md](README_singularity.md)

This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons. See the [rendered lesson website](https://epcced.github.io/2020-12-08-Containers-Online/).
